# Neural Network from Scratch

## Introduction
This group project was developed for the Machine Learning course in the Master‚Äôs Degree program at the University of Pisa. The library created was utilized to build the final NN model, which was used to make predictions on the blind test set for the **ML CUP 2025** competition.



## üìñ Overview
This project implements a **neural network from scratch**, the implementation relies solely on core programming constructs and numerical libraries like **NumPy**, avoiding high-level machine learning frameworks. The goal is to provide a deeper understanding of the fundamental concepts behind neural networks, including forward propagation, backpropagation, weight updates, and optimization techniques.

## üöÄ Features
- Fully customizable neural network architecture
- Forward and backward propagation.
- Gradient-based optimization (e.g., Stochastic Gradient Descent, Momentum).
- Example datasets for testing (e.g., classification, regression).
